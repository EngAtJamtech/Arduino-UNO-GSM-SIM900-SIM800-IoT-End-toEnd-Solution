# Introduction
This article will show you how to roll-your-own simple end-to-end internet-of-things (IoT) solution without the need for IoT platforms such as thingspeak or cloudMQTT at virtually no cost. If that appeals to you then read on. 
For simplicity we’ll assume you have a hosting account free or otherwise supporting php and MySql and has some form of control panel to aid setting up the database and uploading and modifying files.
The three main aspects of the end-to-end solution are:
•	Sensor and gateway for sending data to the remote server (Device)
•	Server side application end point (API)
•	Server side user interface (Dashboard)


# Pre-requisites
You will need to have, or obtain, skills in:
-	Arduino hardware and Arduino shields
-	Arduino programming
-	Arduino sketch (basic knowledge)
-	Some PHP understanding
-	Uploading files to a hosting account
-	Setting up MySql database
